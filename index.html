    <p>Auguste and Louis Lumiere arrived in Bombay in 1896 to introduce cinematography. Bombay grew to become the heart of India's Hindi film industry. The first full-length film, "Raja Harishchandra," was made by Dadasaheb Phalke, the pioneer of Indian cinema, in 1913. "Alam Ara," which aired in 1931, was the first Indian film featuring a soundtrack.
       Due to the expanding NRI and Indian communities worldwide, Bollywood dance and cinema have garnered increased international prominence since the 2000s. Along with new talents, the popularity of the show continues to rise. More information about how to do Bollywood dancing may be found here.

<br><br>The word Bollywood comes from Bombay (now Mumbai), India. The Mumbai Film Industry (India's Hindi Film Industry) is known as Bollywood. During the 1970s, the term "Bollywood" was coined. In terms of the number of films produced and released each year, it is India's and the world's largest film industry. When the Indian film business eclipsed the Hollywood film industry, the moniker Bollywood was coined. Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance that you may have heard of.
